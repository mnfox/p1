CSCI E-15 Prac One

Live @ p1.mnfox.me

This project is going to be a collection of my work throughout the course 'CSCI E-15'. It also contains some information about me. At the moment, there is no work to dispaly, however, the site will be updated as work is completed. To build this I used the Skel framework (to ensure responsiveness, a grid design, and to save time when it comes to making things look pretty), FontAwesome (for icons, seen at the bottom for social media), and JQuery, specifically the 'Scrolly' plugin (to ensure a cool parallax scrolling effect with the buttons). I hope this is what you were after!
